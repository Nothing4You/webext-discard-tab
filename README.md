# Discard Tab

This add-on allows discarding (freezing) tabs via right-click.

[Install on addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/discard-tab/)


Discarding, or freezing, tabs removes them from memory and stops all background activity.
The tab will still exist and once you click the tab again, it will reload.
